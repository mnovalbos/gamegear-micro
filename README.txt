This repository keeps some tools intended to help people hacking the Sega Game Gear Micro emulator.
These tools will work only with the Black GG Micro emulator, untested in any other version. Any 
resemblance with any "standard" tool is merely a coincidence, I didn't wrote this tools for daily 
use.

Directory "assets":
- Some tools to help editing "assets.bin" file, which keeps all the files used by the emulator. After 
repacking the "assets.bin" file, this tool will generate a "patch" file that will be used with the next 
patch tools. 
Directory "elfPatcher"
- Some tools to help hacking the emulator itself. Given a fresh copy of Sega's GG micro emulator,
PatcherSearch will search for some values/offsets/indexes inside the executable file, and generate
a text file with the vaules found. These values can be used inside the "assets" project, in order to generate 
"patch" files.
- ElfPatcher will take a "patch" file generated by "assets" project, and will patch the "app" emulator exec file
with new values/instructions
